## Submission Instructions

### Overview
BurlApp is an attempt at applying concepts I've learned from launchcode to hypothetically make facets of running a coffee shop easier. The intention of this app is to create the most ideal work schedule possible that fulfills the needs of the store & the employees by allowing user input for schedules & checking it against a series of requisites & allowing for export as an (image? pdf? excel spreadsheet?) & retain records for posterity as well
### Features
Schedule Creation - Users will be able to take object based employees (this isn't rich satire on the service industry's tendency to be dehumanizing)
Editing Employee/Store Needs - editing/confirming schedule requirements 
Schedule Publishing - Exporting schedule for easy viewing!
Viewing History - Looking at the history of schedules/maybe abstracts like hours worked for any given employee object
### Technologies
Javascript? React? Some kind of backend for CRUD, I haven't thought about this part much yet
### What I'll Have to Learn
Maybe react for frontend, how to export data created by app as a spreadsheet or some other format for publishing to Employees/etc, publishing data to some format that is recognizable by the app as historical entries for the schedule
